# Medal-Prediction-Model Project Overview
This model predicts how many medals each country will win in the Olympics using a linear regression model.

# Dataset
Based on an Olympic dataset containing the team, country, year, number of events competed in, number of athletes, average age of athletes, average heights and weights of athletes, number of medals earned, and number of previous medals earned, we will train a machine learning model to predict the number of medals that will be earned in the upcoming Olympic Games.

Data is from the Olympics, sourced from Kaggle.
